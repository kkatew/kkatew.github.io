					<p class="sectionBody" id="whyBody">When a species becomes endangered or extinct, it implies that the ecosystem is slowly being destroyed, because the loss of one species can disrupt many others, as well as their food chain, creating a vicious cycle.</p>
					<p class="sectionBody">Since nature provides various benefits to human beings, the endangerment or extinction of species will directly impact human life. Therefore, we should take every measure to keep this planet clean and healthy so that future generations can prosper.</p>

					<p class="sectionTitle" id="whyConserveTitle">Why is it important to conserve wildlife?</p>
					<p class="sectionBody" id="whyConserveBody">Wildlife species are declining substantially due to rapid changes to their ecosystems. Studies have shown that the wildlife population have dropped 69% globally since 1970, in which overharvesting, pollution, habitat loss, climate change, and the spread of diseases are the main drivers of the dramatic decline. Human activities have played a huge role in each of these cases.</p>
					<p class="sectionBody">One of the main reasons is that wildlife conservation aids species survival. For instance, every time a species is threatened, we disrupt the ecosystems that many of our industries depend on. In addition, endangered species also secures human survival, as letting go of the endangered might lead to catastrophic impacts on human life.</p>
